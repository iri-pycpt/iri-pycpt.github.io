## PyCPT: The Python Interface to the Climate Predictability Tool (CPT)

PyCPT is a set of python libraries designed to interface with CPT to facilitate operational climate forecasting and research in Python. It is the principal tool used to implement the IRI's "NextGen" approach to climate forecasting in partner countries around the world. In version two, PyCPT has been re-designed from the ground up, and packaged with Anaconda to lower the barriers to Python climate forecasting.
