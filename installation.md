## Installation

PyCPT is packaged and distributed with [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution). You will need to download and install an Anaconda distribution of Python in order to use PyCPT. 

Anaconda provides a self explanatory graphical installer- an application which will guide you through the steps necessary to install the Anaconda command line interface. 

Once you have installed Anaconda open a terminal / command line application. If you're working on a MacOS machine, use the Terminal app; Windows users should use the Anaconda Prompt app, and linux users can use whichever command line application they normally use. 

If Anaconda has installed correctly, the terminal prompt will be prefaced by ```(base)```- this is the name of the default Anaconda environment.
